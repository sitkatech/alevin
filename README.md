Alevin is Environmental Science Associates's service which is based on Project Firma.

U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is a contemporary water management agency with a strategic plan covering numerous programs, initiatives, and activities that support the Western States, Native American Tribes, and others to address water needs — such as hydropower electricity and irrigation — while balancing the multitude of competing water uses.

To fulfill water delivery obligations, water conservation, and water recycling and reuse, they must find new ways to bring together the various interests while addressing the competing needs of our limited water supply. This case study focuses on the Columbia and Snake River Salmon Recovery Office (CSRO), a Bureau sub-program that works to improve and restore salmonid habitat impacted by the operation and maintenance of Federal dam facilities as part of the Columbia River Federal Hydropower System (FCRPS) Endangered Species Act (ESA) consultation with NOAA Fisheries. These efforts include the design of specific habitat features for various life stages of salmonids in various Columbia Basin tributary streams and rivers.
