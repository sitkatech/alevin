Todo:
-Implement ImageHelper.CreateDrawing for .NET Standard.

Consider:
-Reuse image parts where possible. 
-Support C# 6.
-Use a proper C# parser, so there are no potential issues with e.g. brackets in strings/comments/etc.
-Support code blocks in DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Vml.TextPath.String.
-Implement a better CreateHyperlink method, because the one in the Inheritance sample doesn't always insert the link at the right place.
-Insert merge fields.
-Multiple calls to write in the same code block should result in concatenated text.
-Implement ViewBag.

Won't fix:
-Support contructed generic types as Model in .NET v3.5.
