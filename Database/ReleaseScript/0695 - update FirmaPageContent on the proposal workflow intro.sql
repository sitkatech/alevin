set FirmaPageContent = '<p>Use this workflow to input a proposal for a new project. Proposals are typically projects that have not yet been selected for implementation. They may be conceptual, or they may be more fleshed out but awaiting evaluation and prioritization.</p>  <p>The various aspects of your project that must be included in a project proposal can be seen on the left. Several of these sections are optional, but others are required. The required sections are:</p>  <ul>  <li><strong>Basics:</strong>&nbsp;You must enter the project&#39;s estimated start and completion dates and estimated costs.</li>  <li><strong>Location - Simple:</strong>&nbsp;You must input your project&#39;s location via an interactive map or provide a short location description.</li>  <li><strong>Expected Accomplishments:</strong>&nbsp;You must enter at least one expected Accomplishment, or provide a note why this information is not available.</li>  <li><strong>Focal Species:</strong>&nbsp;You must enter at least one Focal Species that your project will support, and provide a description of how it will do so.</li>  <li><strong>Project Goals:&nbsp;</strong>You must enter at least one Project Goal that your project will attain or support, and provide a description of how it will do so.</li> </ul>  <p>Once all required sections are complete you may submit the proposal for review. Submitting a project proposal will notify the ESA Database administrators. After review, your proposal will either be approved, or the reviewer will contact you for follow up.</p>'
