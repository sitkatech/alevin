The intensity of a fire is the most important factor determining whether a residence would survive a wildfire.

While homeowners are responsible for treating fuels around their homes, the currently required treatment zone may prove inadequate in certain areas with steep slopes and heavy fuels downhill of the home. Treating the recommended areas would reduce fuels for a much greater distance below homes at risk. This wider fuelbreak would reduce the heat output and rate of fire spread..'),

Initially, grazing would likely use approximately 600 sheep. The sheep would be rotated to the different treatment areas once fuels are adequately grazed in the target areas. Sheep would be confined to target grazing areas using electric fences. Prior to grazing, invading shrubs and small non-native trees in grasslands would be cut using either mechanical equipment or hand crews. Grazing would be conducted under a grazing prescription developed by the grazing contractor and TSRA staff. Grazing would be monitoried to ensure that overgrazing does not occur and that there is no significant effect on desirable native species or other natural resource values.
Rationale: Reducing grasses in large grassland areas adjacent to and/or below homes would substantially reduce the fire hazard. It would be more difficult for fires to ignite in grazed areas, and, if a fire does ignite, it would burn much slower across grazed land. The removal of shrubs in the grassland would reduce the chance for torching. Reduction in grass height would reduce the chance of a fire burning into the crowns of adjacent wooded areas. Livestock grazing would decrease the chance of a fire burning into the crowns of adjacent wooded areas. Livestock grazing would decrease the chance of shrub invasion of grassland areas, as livestock would browse or tarample new shrub shoots or resprouts.
A proper grazing program can also benefit certain native grasses and forbs by reducing the buildup of thatch produced by non-native grass species. Many species of grassland plants are adapted to and may rely on periodic grazing.
While some areas proposed for grazing could be mowed with a mechanical mower, many steeper areas would require hand crews using weed whippers. Livestock grazing is a less expensive way of reducing these grassland fuels, which need to be reduced every year..'),
